/**
   \class SecureMessage qca_securemessage.h QtCrypto

   Class representing a secure message

   SecureMessage presents a unified interface for working with both
   OpenPGP and CMS (S/MIME) messages.  Prepare the object by calling
   setFormat(), setRecipient(), and setSigner() as necessary, and then
   begin the operation by calling an appropriate 'start' function, such
   as startSign().

   Here is an example of how to perform a Clearsign operation using PGP:

   \code
// first make the SecureMessageKey
PGPKey myPGPKey = getSecretKeyFromSomewhere();
SecureMessageKey key;
key.setPGPSecretKey(myPGPKey);

// our data to sign
QByteArray plain = "Hello, world";

// let's do it
OpenPGP pgp;
SecureMessage msg(&pgp);
msg.setSigner(key);
msg.startSign(SecureMessage::Clearsign);
msg.update(plain);
msg.end();
msg.waitForFinished(-1);

if(msg.success())
{
	QByteArray result = msg.read();
	// result now contains the clearsign text data
}
else
{
	// error
	...
}
   \endcode

   Performing a CMS sign operation is similar.  Simply set up the
   SecureMessageKey with a Certificate instead of a PGPKey, and operate on a
   CMS object instead of an OpenPGP object.
